# Reafel Mobile App

The REAFEL(Reaching the Frail Elderly Patient for optimizing diagnosis of atrial fibrillation) mobile app will help patients record and monitor their heart rhythm. The application will connect to external Holter monitor device to collect ECG data along with any other sensor data available (eg: accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature etc). Additionally, the app will also collect patient-reported outcomes and contextual information (physical activities, symptoms, and mood etc) from the patient. The app will visualize the collected data in a meaningful way so that patients can understand their heart condition, relate to their physical and mental health, and take actions accordingly.
